# Measuring San Francisco’s Muni Bus Line Delays as Ridership Expands

San Francisco’s Muni bus lines have been in flux for the past two or more years due to the repercussions and restrictions of COVID-19. As ridership has been steadily increasing, riding the bus during peak commuting hours has proved that popular bus lines experience delays, crowding, and congestion- similar to what it was like riding the bus pre-pandemic. This project aims to look at what has been observed for those recently riding the bus and look at the muni system as a whole to see which bus lines are experiencing the most delays. In this exercise, I analyze and visualize SFMTA ridership data, SFMTA Muni route data, static GTFS data, and GTFS-RT data from the year 2019 to 2022. In looking at this time period, we will be able to see conditions of riding the bus pre-pandemic, when ridership and bus frequency was at a high while setting a baseline, to what it was like riding the bus during the height of the pandemic, and to now. In doing so, we hope to understand how the Muni bus network could alleviate some of its delays and congestion on popular lines. 

## Background

My motivation for this project was to understand what I have been experiencing on my commute by utilizing the python skills I have learned in the past year. As I have been commuting from San Francisco to Berkeley during peak hours on the weekdays, my normal route is taking the 38 or 38 Rapid from my home to Powell street, where I then get off and walk over to the Powell BART station and transfer to rail. I observed a stark difference from my commute in 2021 to 2022, starting around February to March of this year, and was shocked on the crowding I was seeing that I documented through photos of what I was experiencing.
